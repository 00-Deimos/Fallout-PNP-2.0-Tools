            "description" : "A measure of your character's physical strength and muscle power. Characters with a high Strength probably spent a lot of time in the gym in high school. Characters with low Strength probably got beat up by the characters with high Strength. This statistic is used in the secondary statistics Carry Weight, Melee Damage, and Hit Points. All weapons have a minimum Strength requirement as well. Rolls against Strength are used when characters try to break doors down, bend the bars on their prison cell, and do other feats that require sheer muscle power.",

Perceptive characters notice details instantly, like smells, sounds, and sights that don't fit a normal picture. Perceptive characters tend to be able to read another person's reactions, and can even tell when another person is lying. Highly perceptive characters are private investigators. Characters with low Perception walk about in their own little world. This statistic is used in the Sequence secondary statistic, and in several skills such as Lockpick, Traps, First Aid, and Doctor. The primary use of this statistic is to determine the maximum distance your character can shoot a ranged weapon effectively. The better the score, the farther you can accurately shoot. A high Perception is imperative for a sniper. Rolls against Perception are used when there is a little detail the character has a chance of noticing, such as the glisten off the scope of the sniper taking an aim at his or her head.",

Characters with low Endurance can drown in the kiddie pool. The Hit Point, Poison Resistance, Radiation Resistance, and Healing Rate secondary statistics are based on Endurance, which also modifies a character's Outdoorsman skill. Endurance is used to determine if burst hits knock characters down, or even unconscious. Rolls against Endurance determine things like whether your character can hang on to that rope over a canyon, or can resist the deadly cloud of bacteria that renegade scientist just sprayed in his or her face.",

Kennedy was charismatic; Dan Quayle was not. No secondary statistics are based on Charisma. It heavily influences Barter and Speech skills.

Characters with high Agility are jugglers and acrobats. Characters with low Agility dance with two left feet. This statistic is the basis for the Armor Class and Action Point secondary statistics.
